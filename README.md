***Movie Recommender System***
**Introduction**
A movie recommender system developed to demonstrate the three main types of recommendation methods:

**Content-based**: Focuses purely on the content features of movies.
**Collaborative filtering**: Assumes that if User A and User B have similar tastes, movies liked by User A can be recommended to User B.
**Hybrid**: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
